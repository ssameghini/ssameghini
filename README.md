- 👋 Hi, I’m @ssameghini, a Jr Web Developer from Argentina. I have a university degree in Psychology and Education.
- 👀 I’m interested in the Javscript environment for developing: its libraries and frameworks, especially the MERN stack.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to setup a complete web app from server to client, focusing on security and customizing user experiences.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a wide range of issues for initial developers, as I can grow knowledge and experience from there.
I think of myself as a really good learner and a canny observer.
- 📫 You can reach me here or at s.sameghini@gmail.com
