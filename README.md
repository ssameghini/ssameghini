# Sebastián Sameghini - Web Developer

- 👋 Hi, I’m Sebastián Sameghini, a Full-Stack Web Developer from Argentina. I mainly work in the Backend area since 2021, but I complement that with some Frontend development and DevOps engineering. I have a degree in Psychology and Education, which complements my developing with teamwork and social resources.
- 👷 I'm currently working as a Backend Developer for [Steplix](https://steplix.com/), focusing on the design and implementation of solutions for several web-based projects. I mainly work with microservices and serverless infrastructures, written in Javascript and Typescript.
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my set of skills and tools for developing in backend environments, especially with AWS. I've achieved the *AWS Cloud Practitioner* certification, that requires a wide knowledge of Amazon Web Services in areas such as infrastructure, processing, file storing, databases managing and networking.
- 🌱 I’m currently deepening my skills at AWS Cloud services and studying for the *AWS Solutions Architect*.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on solving the social issue of making the information more accessible for everyone, and enabling more democratic platforms for discussion and the growing of ideas.
I think of myself as a really good learner and a canny observer.
