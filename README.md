# Sebastián Sameghini - Web Developer

- 👋 Hi, I’m Sebastián Sameghini, a Jr. Web Developer from Argentina. I have a degree in Psychology and Education, which complements my developing with teamwork and social resources. I'm currently working as a Full Stack Developer for Steplix, mainly designing and implementing microservices for several projects.
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my set of skills and tools for developing in backend environments, especially with AWS.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying how to setup a complete web app from server to client, focusing on **security** and customizing user experiences. I contribute regularly to Open Source projects to keep my technique sharp and get to know different teams and their workflows.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a wide range of issues for initial developers, as I can grow knowledge and experience from there.
I think of myself as a really good learner and a canny observer.
