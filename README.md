# Sebastián Sameghini - Web Developer

- 👋 Hi, I’m Sebastián Sameghini, a Jr. Web Developer from Argentina. I have a degree in Psychology and Education, which complements my developing with teamwork and social resources.
- 👀 I’m interested in the Javscript environment for developing: from vanilla to its libraries and frameworks, especially the MERN stack.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying how to setup a complete web app from server to client, focusing on security and customizing user experiences. I contribute regularly to Open Source projects to keep my technique sharp and get to know different teams and their workflows.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a wide range of issues for initial developers, as I can grow knowledge and experience from there.
I think of myself as a really good learner and a canny observer.
